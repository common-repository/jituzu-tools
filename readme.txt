Jituzu enables secure HIPAA-compliant online scheduling of clients and patients from a Wordpress site.

== Description ==

Jituzu is the premiere HIPAA-compliant platform for securely connecting service providers with the people they provider services to.  Online scheduling, appointment reminders, secure messaging and online bill pay are part of the Jituzu platform.  While you have complete control over which services you use, and with whom, Jituzu is intended to be used as the scheduler for the entire business. You have the option of allowing new clients to create an account with their service provider and schedule an appointment, or just allow certain existing clients to book new appointments.  

Jituzu is a fully-interactive platform.  Appointments are not merely "requested" pending acceptance, but they are placed on the calendar when there are openings that fit within the office hours and other guidelines set by the service provider.  You can even set rules for an individual client! (i.e. "Only allow Billy Brown to schedule on Tuesday afternoons where there is a 2-hour window)  Group practices can keep individual calendars while still allowing sharing between permitted services providers that are part of the group.

Jituzu meets the HIPAA-security requirements and includes a Business Associate Agreeement (BAA) as part of the subscriber agreement as required by U.S. law in order for Healthcare providers to meet their HIPAA obligations.  This requires acceptance of the Jituzu subscriber agreement and in most cases, a paid subscription to individual services.

Non-healthcare customers (we have a lot of those, too) benefit from the high level of privacy and security required in healthcare, but will also enjoy being able to customize the terminology used to refer to customers, clients, patients, members, students, and so forth.  The bottom line is that Jituzu is extraordinarly flexible and easy to use.

This plugin places a customizable iframe on your wordpress website, allowing your clientele to log in and use the Jituzu options you have granted.

* Online account signup for new clients

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What does this cost? =

While the base level of service for Jituzu is free, this plugin interacts with the **Client Portal** paid service option.  Check the Jituzu website for current pricint, but at the time of this writing a Client Portal subscription was $14.95 per month.

= Is this HIPAA-compliant? =

Yes. Jituzu, or any other third-party service, needs to meet the requirements of a *Business Associate* for any covered entity.  This includes contractual security and privacy obligations written in a **Business Associate Agreement (BAA)**.  Jituzu includes the HIPAA-required BAA provisions in our subscriber agreement.

Here's a link to [HHS.gov](http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/privacy/hipaa/understanding/coveredentities/businessassociates.html "HHS.gov") that describes the HIPAA requirements more fully.

= How does online bill-pay work? =

Online bill pay works with a credit card merchant account that you activate within your Jituzu account with our processing partner.  Currently, it is only available to healthcare providers.  This feature enables clients to view and pay their bills online.  Bills are automatically generated by partner billing companies of Jituzu, such as My Clients Plus.  When a bill is paid online, the amounts can also be automatically posted to the individual client account of the billing entity such as My Clients Plus.  If online bill pay is not active in the service provider account, the Balance Due menu option will not be visible.

= How do I set up my Jituzu account, and what the options? =

There's a button inside the plugin setup that steps you through a minimal client portal setup.  There are many other options for you to control what the clients see from within the portal.  All of these settings are available by logging in to www.jituzu.com.  The full calendar is also accessed by logging in to the main site.

= How does it work when a new client books an appointment? =

You have the choice as to whether you allow new clients to create their own accounts and book an online appointment.  You can also choose not to allow online appointment schedule altogether (if you just want to use messaging, for example).  If you enable new clients to signup, they can create their username and password along with their security questions (in case they forget their password).  The first time they log in, they'll be prompted to complete their basic profile information along with any custom fields you require them to complete.  The service provider is notified immediately when a new client creates a Jituzu account.


== Screenshots ==

1. This is a sample view of what the client will see when they first log in to their client account.  Any new messages are clearly visible in their inbox.
2. Clicking on the Appointments menu option allows the user to see their upcoming appointments, past appointments, or to request a new appointment.
3. The user can also look for available openings weeks or months into the future.
4. If the user enters any notes when they schedule, they'll be visible to the service provider in the main calendar.
